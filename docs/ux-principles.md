# Some of the UX principles adhered while developing KIT

## Define problems out of existence

### Farewell - always Edited

There are many issues one can think of while working on an application - _possibly valid_ use-cases which (from the first point of view) need attention. E.g. Farewell (as a entity) - needs being created, updated, deleted? So we have to create two or potentially more views. The better approach would be whenever user creates a farewell there instantly would be a new farewell that from that moment onward is only edited.
