# Overview

The ultimately goal of retweet logic (WIP) is to see the all retweets from the user (obviously) and all retweets from the profiles he/she follows.

## Current implementation

Currently (26-07-2023) user see's all the re-tweets of posts he / she follows but not the re-tweets when profile he follows retweets something from the profile user does not follow.
